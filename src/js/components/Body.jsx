                        In 1977, the Oregon Legislature adopted the state‚Äôs
                        indeterminate (parole matrix) sentencing system.
                        Effective November 1, 1989, the legislature replaced
                        that system with the Oregon Sentencing Guidelines, a
                        determinate sentencing system. The differences between
                        indeterminate and determinate sentencing systems are
                        discussed later in this chapter. Under either system:

                        213-002-0001Statement of Purposes and Principles (1) The
                        primary objectives of sentencing are to punish each
                        offender appropriately, and to insure the security of
                        the people in person and property, within the limits of
                        correctional resources provided by the Legislative
                        Assembly, local governments and the people. (2)
                        Sentencing guidelines are intended to forward the
                        objectives described in section (1) by defining
                        presumptive punishments for felony convictions, subject
                        to judicial discretion to deviate for substantial and
                        compelling reasons; and presumptive punishments for
                        post-prison or probation supervision violations, again
                        subject to deviation. (3) The basic principles which
                        underlie these guidelines are: (a) The response of the
                        corrections system to crime, and to violation of
                        post-prison and probation supervision, must reflect the
                        resources available for that response. A corrections
                        system that overruns its resources is a system that
                        cannot deliver its threatened punishment or its
                        rehabilitative impact. This undermines the system‚Äôs
                        credibility with the public and the offender, and
                        vitiates the objectives of prevention of recidivism and
                        reformation of the offender. A corrections system that
                        overruns its resources can produce costly litigation and
                        the threat of loss of system control to the federal
                        judiciary. A corrections system that overruns its
                        resources can increase the risk to life and property
                        within the system and to the public. (b) Oregon‚Äôs
                        current sentencing system combines indeterminate
                        sentences with a parole matrix. Although many citizens
                        believe the indeterminate sentence sets the length of
                        imprisonment, that sentence only sets an offender‚Äôs
                        maximum period of incarceration and the matrix controls
                        actual length of stay. The frequent disparity between
                        the indeterminate sentence length and time served under
                        the matrix confuses and angers the public and damages
                        the corrections system‚Äôs credibility with the public.
                        Sentences of imprisonment should represent the time an
                        offender will actually serve, subject only to any
                        reduction authorized by law. (c) Under sentencing
                        guidelines the response to many crimes will be state
                        imprisonment. Other crimes will be punished by local
                        penalties and restrictions imposed as part of probation.
                        All offenders released from prison will be under
                        post-prison supervision for a period of time. The
                        ability of the corrections system to enforce swiftly and
                        sternly the conditions of both probation and post-prison
                        supervision, including by imprisonment, is crucial. Use
                        of state institutions as the initial punishment for
                        crime must, therefore, leave enough institutional
                        capacity to permit imprisonment, when appropriate, for
                        violation of probation and post-prison supervision
                        conditions. (d) Subject to the discretion of the
                        sentencing judge to deviate and impose a different
                        sentence in recognition of aggravating and mitigating
                        circumstances, the appropriate punishment for a felony
                        conviction should depend on the seriousness of the crime
                        of conviction when compared to all other crimes and the
                        offender‚Äôs criminal history. (e) Subject to the
                        sentencing judge‚Äôs discretion to deviate in recognition
                        of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the
                        corrections system should seek to respond in a
                        consistent way to like crimes combined with like
                        criminal histories; and in a consistent way to like
                        violations of probation and post-prison supervision
                        conditions.

                        The Legislative Assembly hereby declares that, as a
                        matter of statewide concern, it is in the best interests
                        of the people of this state that the judicial branch of
                        state government, including the appellate, tax and
                        circuit courts, be funded and operated at the state
                        level. The Legislative Assembly finds that state funding
                        and operation of the judicial branch can provide for
                        best statewide allocation of governmental resources
                        according to the actual needs of the people and of the
                        judicial branch by establishing an accountable,
                        equitably funded and uniformly administered system of
                        justice for all the people of this state. [1981 s.s. c.3
